# micrograd

 An implementation of the micrograd repository shown in this video https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0. I have a slighly easier DFS implementation, but everything else is the same.

 Next step is to 
 1. add a MLP feature to the code
 2. Use it to train the MLP on a simple data set (I'm thinking Kaggle's Titanic?)
